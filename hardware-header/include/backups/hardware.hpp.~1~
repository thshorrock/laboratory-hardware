 * @section purpose_sec Purpose
 * 
 * Provide a cross platform c++ interface to the Lecroy Waverunner oscilloscope.
 *
 * This is provided curtosy of the ICR::lecroy::lecroy_com class.
 *
 * @section example_sec Example:
@code
#include "lecroy.hpp"
int
main  (int ac, char **av)
{
  //use the Lecroy namespace
  using namespace ICR::lecroy;
  
  // Open a connection to the lecroy scope by creating a lecroy_com object.
  // The string  containes is the IP address of the scope, which is in this example 193.62.12.322.
  lecroy_com lc("193.62.12.322"); 
  
  //set channel 1 to 50 ohm DC coupling      
  lc.set_coupling(location::C1, coupling::D50); 

  //The connection automatically closes when lc runs out of scope.
}
@endcode

\section feature_sec Feature
A swig interface file is provided for this library.
This means that a wrapper to the c++ library is easily created for any of the following languages:
 - AllegroCL
 - C# - Mono
 - C# - MS .NET
 - CFFI
 - CHICKEN
 - CLISP
 - Go language
 - Guile
 - Java
 - Lua
 - MzScheme
 - Ocaml
 - Octave (and Matlab via Octave)
 - Perl
 - PHP
 - Python
 - R
 - Ruby
 - Tcl/Tk

The interface to the python library is automatically compiled.
The following python script repeates the previous example.
@code
  #!/usr/bin/python                #Identify where to find python. 
  from hardware_lecroy import *    #import the module named hardware_lecroy
  lc = lecroy_com("193.62.12.322") #open the connection
  lc.set_coupling(C1,D50)          #set the coupling
@endcode


\section dependancies_sec Dependancies.
 This library uses the Boost c++ libraries.  These are already included in the distribution.

\section git_repo_sec Location of the Repository

\section installation_sec Installation

This library is most conveniently installed with bjam (on both Windows and Linux based operating systems).
 - First setup bjam (which can be downloaded from http://www.boost.org/)
 - go to the root directory and type:
  \code bjam --v2 \endcode

@section licence_sec Licence
Since the library uses the Boost c++ libraries, the Boost lisence applies.
